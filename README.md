# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis:

* The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results

* Below is the updated filter table without any filters in place.

* The new update allowing users to filter using multiple criteria works properly. As shown in the table below and gives precise results.

* You are able to get a more precise result using all five filters but the table will also yield results with just one or two filters. The table below shows the results using only two filters date and shape.

## Summary
The drawback of this webpage is what also may work well for the webpage. The first drawback is that the user must know all five filter requirements to get a more precise result. That is amazing but there may be some users that may not know all or the correct information for the filters to get the results that are searching for. Another major drawback is the filters will not return results if they are not lower-case. That will pose a major problem of concern if a user capitallized any letters then no results will display.

### Recommendations
* My first recommendation will be to not make the text that is entered in the filtered fields case sensative.
* The second recommendation would be to expand the date filter option into a date range.
